// You are an adventurer and you have come across a tall staircase with n steps to reach the top. You decide to take on the challenge and start climbing the stairs. You quickly realize that there are two ways to climb each step: either take 1 step at a time, or take 2 steps at once.

// Can you figure out how many different ways you can climb to the top?

// Example 1:
// Input:
// n = 2

// Output:
// 2

// Explanation:
// There are two ways to climb to the top.

// 1 step + 1 step
// 2 steps
// Example 2:
// Input:
// n = 3

// Output:
// 3

// Explanation:
// There are three ways to climb to the top.

// 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
// 1 step + 2 steps
// 2 steps + 1 step
